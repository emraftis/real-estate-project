# real-estate-project

## Project Description: 
This website is a project created by Evan Raftis using VueJS. The idea for the project is to allow anyone to calculate and compare NOI and project values. It also allows the user to save the project, or export the calculated data to an Excel file. This project was initially started as a tool to help with quickly generating excel templates that I would use for my job as a commercial loan underwriter. 

## Tech Stack: 
Firebase was used as the backend for ease of use and incorporating user authentication tokens. Vue was used as the front-end. 

## Future Additions: 
I would like to add in an Edit function for each project, eventually.
